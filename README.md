## 📍 Real-Life Scenario

Imagine this:  
A young biker meets with a road accident and is unconscious when brought to the hospital. The doctors need to know if he has any chronic conditions, allergies, or blood type — but no one is around who knows.  
Instead of guessing or delaying treatment, a paramedic scans the **QR code** on his phone lock screen — instantly revealing vital, pre-approved medical data stored in **MedVault**.

Treatment starts immediately, correctly, and safely.
